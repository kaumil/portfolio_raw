Performed Exploratory Analysis on fraud detection dataset and tried to find interaction terms. Moreover, compared various classifiers offered by the scikit-learn library. Classifiers used are:
- Support Vector Classifier (with RBF Kernel)
- Support Vector Classifier (with Linear Kernel)
- Random Forests
- Bagging Classifier
- Logistic Regression
- KNN Classifier
- LDA Classifier
- GaussianNB Classifier
- DecisionTree Classifier
- GradientBoosting Classifier
- XGBoost Classifier
- Extra Trees Classifier
