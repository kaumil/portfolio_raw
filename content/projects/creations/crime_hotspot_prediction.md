  "description": "Experimented to utilise a novel Convolutional LSTM model to extract spatio-temporal features to predict crime hotspots over Vancouver city with 82% recall and 71% precision. Worked on developing a data collection api to extend model training for multiple cities and predit crime-wise hotspots.",
