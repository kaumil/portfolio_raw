      <description>In this work, we propose a hybrid binary classifier which combines a decision tree with a support vector machine. The proposed hybrid model has the advantages of improved accuracy and easy interpretability. The model will be useful for feature selection cum classification tasks in real-world supervised learning problems. Numerical evidence is also provided using 25 standard data sets from various fields to assess the performance of the model. Performance of the proposed hybrid binary classifier is quite better when compared to individual classifiers.</description>

      <description>Performed Exploratory Analysis on fraud detection dataset and tried to find interaction terms. Moreover, compared various classifiers offered by the scikit-learn library. Classifiers used are:
 Support Vector Classifier (with RBF Kernel) Support Vector Classifier (with Linear Kernel) Random Forests Bagging Classifier Logistic Regression KNN Classifier LDA Classifier GaussianNB Classifier DecisionTree Classifier GradientBoosting Classifier XGBoost Classifier Extra Trees Classifier  </description>

      <description>Sentiment Analyzer is a ML model as a service made using Flask micro framework. The task is a binary classification problem where I employed CNNs to have a validation accuracy of 84.73% and validation loss of 0.3624. The application serves 2 pipeline: 1 pipeline where the model versions are trained using the jupyter notebook in the sentiment_analysis subfolder. The second pipeline is the inference pipeline where using a config file, Tensorflow Serving is used to deploy that model on a different docker container.</description>
